# Challenges with testing exemptions:
#
# - exemptions require scorecards that have evaluated with failing rules;
#   testing assumes no tenanted data, so this condition needs to be created as part of the test
#
# - there is no public API to force evaluation of a scorecard; can look into possibility of using
#   an internal endpoint for this
#
# - could create a scorecard as part of the test and wait for it to complete, but completion time for
#   evaluating a scorecard is non-deterministic and, as experienced with query API tests, completion
#   time can be 15 minutes or more, which will increase the time to complete testing by a factor of 5x
#   or more
#
# - exemptions requested by an API key with the Cortex ADMIN role are auto-approved, so the exemption must
#   be requested with a key that has non-ADMIN privileges
#
#   This means there are dependencies on running a test using a VIEWER role to request the exemption and a
#   subsequent test using an ADMIN role to act on the exemption
#
# So this is how we'll roll for now . . .
# - Automated tests currently run in known tenants that have the 'cli-test-scorecard' in an evaluated state.
# - So we can semi-reliably count on an evaluated scorecard to exist.
